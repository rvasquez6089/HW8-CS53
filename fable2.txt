The ant and the grasshopper fable. One summer's day, a grasshopper was hopping about, chirping and singing to its heart's content. An ant passed by, bearing along with great toil a cornkernal he was taking to the nest. "Why not come and chat with me," said the grasshopper, "instead of toiling in that way?" "I am helping to lay up food for the winter", said the ant. "And I recommend you to do likewise." "Why bother about the winter?" said the grasshopper, "we have plenty of food at the present."  But the ant went on its way and continued its toil.  When the winter came the grasshopper had no food and found itself dying of hunger, while it saw the ant distributing every day the corn and the grain from the stores they had collected in the summer.  The the grasshopper knew it is best to prepare for the days of necessity.
