Moe Fable #1: The Barfly and the skateboard fable.One summer's day, a skateboard was hopping about, chirping and singing to its heart's content. An Barfly passed by, bearing along with great toil a cornkernal he was taking to the nest.  I like creatin' disappointment.
 "Why not come and chat with me," said the skateboard, "instead of toiling in that way?" "I am helping to lay up food for the winter", said the Barfly. "And I recommend you to do likewise.  Aaaaaarg-eeeehg-ahaah.  I'm chokin' on my own rage here.
" "Why bother about the winter?" said the skateboard, "we have plenty of food at the present."  But the Barfly went on its way and continued its toil.  I like creatin' disappointment.
  When the winter came the skateboard had no food and found itself dying of hunger, while it saw the Barfly distributing every day the corn and the grain from the stores they had collected in the summer.  The the skateboard knew it is best to prepare for the days of necessity.  Hah!  That's probably a good one.
