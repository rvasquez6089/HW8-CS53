The man and the trees fable. A man came into a forest one day with a axe in his hand, and begged all the trees to give him a branch which he wanted for a purpose.  The trees were good-natured and gave him one of their branches.  What did the man do but fix it into the axe head and soon set to work cutting down trees.  Then the trees saw how foolish they had been in giving their enemy the means of destroying themselves.
