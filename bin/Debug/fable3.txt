The fox and the goat fable. By an unlucky chance, a fox fell into a well from which he could not get out.  A goat passed by shortly afterwards and asked the fox what he was doing down there. "Oh, have you not heard?" said the fox, "There is going to be a drought, so I jumped down here in order to be sure to have water by me.  Why don't you come down too?"  The goat thought well of the advice, and jumped down into the well.  But the fox immediately jumped on her back and, by putting his foot on her long horns, managed to jump up to the edge of the well.  "Good-bye, friend," said the fox, "remember next time never trust the advice of a man in difficulties."
