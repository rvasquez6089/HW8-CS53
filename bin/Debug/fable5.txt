The milkmaid and the milkpail fable. Patty the milkmaid was going to the market carrying her milkpail on her head.  As she went along she began to calculate what she would do with the money she would get for the milk. "I'll buy a fowl from Farmer Brown," said she, "and she will lay a egg each morning, which I will sell to the parson's wife.  With the money that I get from the sale of these eggs, I'll buy myself a new frock and a hat.  And when I go to market, won't all the men come up and speak to me!  Polly will be jealous, but I won't care.  I shall just look at her and toss my head like this.  As shen spoke she tossed her head back, the milkpail fell off it, and all the milk was spilt.  So she had to go home and tell her mother what had occurred. "Ah, my child," said the mother, "do not count the chickens before they hatch."
