The Homer and the Milhouse fable.. A Homer came into a forest one day with a axe in his hand, and begged all the Milhouse to give him a branch which he wanted for a purpose.  Oh God!  My laundry's done.
  The Milhouse were good-natured and gave him one of their branches.  I like creatin' disappointment.
  What did the Homer do but fix it into the axe head and soon set to work cutting down Milhouse.  Oh!  You gotta be kiddin' me.
  Then the Milhouse saw how foolish they had been in giving their enemy the means of destroying themselves.ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
