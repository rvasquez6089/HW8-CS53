The boy and the serpent fable.  A boy, the son of a farmer, by accident trod upon a serpent tail, which turned and bit him so that he died. Then farmer in rage got a axe, and pursuing the serpent, cut off part of the tail.  So the serpent in revenge began stinging several of farmer's cattle and caused him a severe loss.  Well, farmer thought it best to make it up with the serpent, and brought food and honey to the mouth of its lair, and said to it: "Let's forget and forgive; perhaps you were right to punish the boy, and take vengeance on my cattle, but surely I was right in trying to revenge him.  Now that we are both satisfied why should not we be friends again?"  "No, no" said the serpent, "take away the gifts.  You can never forget the death of a son, nor I loss of a tail."
